RecipeBook
==========

Requirements
------------

- Manage recipes (incl. short desc, cooking time, description), ingredients and provenances equivalently to whats done in the app
- Shopping-List functionality (create shopping list, go shopping)
- Sync functionality
	* Import other file (app json and / or internal format including *all* the data)
	* 3-way-merge by keeping the latest sync'd state with different devices, manuel conflict resolving
		-> extend format with per device / instance GUID	
- Import / Export of json files without merge
- PDF-Export of shopping list
- Export to odt / pdf / ? in a style similar to current "Kochbuch Phil & Nicole.odt"

- Possible long term goal: 
	* Remove recipe management from app? 
		-> app only as a shoppinglist tool with easy recipe sync from recipebook? 
		-> would need a convenient data exchange method than copying files manually
		-> this would mean less focus on mergeing, i think
	* Or might it be possible to just base all on this code? I.e. build the app using C++ and Qt? (possibly just with a different UI?)
		-> if so: also include things from apps todo list


Technology
----------

- Qt + c++
	-> Which type of GUI? Qt Widget or Qt Quick + QML?
	-> QML might be useful if I want a similar interface to the app
- Internal file format: sql db? json? xml? something else?
- book output: pdf generate with latex? something else?
	-> does qt directly support other possibilities?
