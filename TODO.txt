5. Exporters
	* Go shopping pdf exporter
	* Kochbuch-Exporter
		-> should be configurable, e.g. the user should be able to define which recipes to export (and which not) and this should be saveable as an export configuration.
		-> the same is true for groupings of recipes (cf. current Kochubuch: Pasta, Reis, Kartoffeln, Brunch, ...)
6. Merge functionality
7. TODOs
8. UnitTests
9. Update and finalize Design.txt!

Possibilities for later:
a. Write json schema?
b. Internal binary file format? (to speed up reading and writing and/or decrease data usage on disc)
c. Add picture to Recipe (and json)?
