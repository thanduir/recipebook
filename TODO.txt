4. Exporters
	* post build step to copy qm files!
	* Export-classes should have a (qml-readable) exportPossible-Method (with no QtHTtml-Exporter, it might just test the existance of the pdflatex executable)

	* Pdf layout changes:
		- recipe items / recipe text: Possibly make the widths different? (recipe text col wider than the other)
		- Larger font sizes on title page (-> Probably need a custom title page for this)

	* remove recipebook.qml from Qt default settings and add to project specific-settings after VS Qt Addin updated! (add all qml files using wildcard if possible)
		(lupdate settings)
	* Try to minimze miktex folder size and copy it to a final place!
		-> Change pdflatex path in RBLatexExporter to final path (RELATIVE PATH SO THAT IT ALSO WORKS FOR INSTALLATIONS...)!
		-> i probably also need to change app working dir for this to work!
		=> remove from .gitignore and commit!
	* Remove the QtHtml exporter? -> yes, if miktex can be reduced to an acceptable folder size
4.2 BUG: Group not together directly after inserting Bibimbap into shopping list!
4.3 json app export (with unnecessary info removed)
	-> as an option in the export dlg (file type selector)! 

5. Investigate "recipebook as an app from the same codebase" (and implement if possible)
	-> How about switching to cmake buildsystem?

6. Merge functionality
	-> Manuell merge (i.e. look for differences, ask user which to preserve) or also automatic merge (as much as possible anyways, using a common ancestor)
7. TODOs
8. UnitTests
9. Update and finalize Design.txt!

Possibilities for later:
a. Internal binary file format? (to speed up reading and writing and/or decrease data usage on disc)
b. Add pictures to Recipe?  (How to do that with json? Or does this depend on a binary internal file format?)
c. cmake based build system (and linux builds)?
