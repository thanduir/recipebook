TODO

4. Exporters
	* Improve layout of recipe book pdf		
	* Try to minimze miktex folder size and copy it to a final place!
		-> Change pdflatex path in RBLatexExporter to final path!
		-> i probably also need to change app working dir for this to work!
		=> remove from .gitignore and commit!
	* Remove the QtHtml exporter? -> yes, if miktex can be reduced to an acceptable folder size
	* Export-class should have a (qml-readable) exportPossible-Method (with no QtHTtml-Exporter, it might just test the existance of the pdflatex executable)
4.2 BUG: Group not together directly after inserting Bibimbap into shopping list!
4.3 json app export (with unnecessary info removed)

5. Investigate "recipebook as an app from the same codebase" (and implement if possible)
6. Merge functionality
	-> Manuell merge (i.e. look for differences, ask user which to preserve) or also automatic merge (as much as possible anyways, using a common ancestor)
7. TODOs
8. UnitTests
9. Update and finalize Design.txt!

Possibilities for later:
a. Internal binary file format? (to speed up reading and writing and/or decrease data usage on disc)
b. Add pictures to Recipe?  (How to do that with json? Or does this depend on a binary internal file format?)
c. cmake based build system (and linux builds)?
