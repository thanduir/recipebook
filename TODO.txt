TODO
====

- Data synchronisation (sync with dropbox)
	* Implement RecipeBookSynchronization and sync UI (where to user gets asked which change to keep in case of problems)
	
	* Test it on android and windows!
		-> ssl missing on android...
		-> https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/android-openssl-support.html
	
	* settings for sync:
		- server file id is changeable
			-> can be cleared or replaced with an EXISTING id (need to check on server before accepting 
				(new method in dropbox class so that not the whole file needs to be dl'd?)!
			-> upon changing of file id, what should happen? (user says which to keep (server or local)? Or always take server version on change?)
		- access token should be clearable!
		- overwrite methods (local to server, server to local)
		- reminder
	* reminder after X days (at startup) that a sync might be needed (configurable in settings: amount of days, 0 == no reminder)!
	* Replace merge with a sync icon?
			

- UPDATE PHONES WITH RELEASE VERSION! (might be slower because of this atm...)

- shopping list page: recipes sortable by due date?

- Android: manifest file + icon missing! How to do this using cmake + qt creator?
- TODOs (depends on Qt bugfixes)


Possible additional features (unsorted)
---------------------------------------

- iPhone version

- add "essensplanung" functionality!
	* data handling between devices?
		-> depends on data exchange between app and desktop program (and between apps)!
		-> how to keep this up to date? separate file (e.g. saved on dropbox similar to current odt?)
	* also add support for something like "Einkaufsliste.txt" (i.e. list of general items to be bought)
	* where to implement this?
		- list separated from shopping list (e.g. because there are items on the shopping list not present in "essensplanung"
			-> shopping list gets the functionality to import a range of dates from "essensplanung"
		- replacement (which might be used concurrently?) to "shopping list page" that directly generates a shopping list for a user-defined time period?

- Add pictures to Recipes?  (How to do that with json? Or does this depend on a binary internal file format?)
- Internal binary file format? (to speed up reading and writing and/or decrease data usage on disc)
