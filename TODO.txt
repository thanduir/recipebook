5. RecipeBook for android
	- Test everything on small screen!
		* ShoppingListPage: + / - buttons for "# persons" rather large...
	
	- manifest file + icon on android! How to do this using cmake + qt creator?

6. Merge functionality
	-> Manuell merge (i.e. look for differences, ask user which to preserve) or also automatic merge (as much as possible anyways, using a common ancestor)
7. Data exchange between app and desktop program?
8. TODOs, UnitTests
9. Update and finalize Design.txt!

Possibilities for later:
a. Internal binary file format? (to speed up reading and writing and/or decrease data usage on disc)
b. Add pictures to Recipe?  (How to do that with json? Or does this depend on a binary internal file format?)
c. Drag'n'drop file load support on desktop?
