TODO
====

- Data synchronisation (sync with dropbox)
	* Implement dropbox class and sync UI (for automatic sync at least, for now)
	* Test it on android and windows!

	* sync page:
		-> what is needed on there? Just questions for results (which to keep)? Or anything more? Status page first (while downloading / setting things up)?
	* merge workflow:
		- dl current version as file and generate recipebook object from it
		- need 3 instances: current dropbox, current app, last merged
		- look for differences and merge automatically if possible
		- handle non-automatic merges (i.e. ask user)
		- replace all 3 instances with up to date version (dropbox, current app, last merged)
	* sync page can be opened manually, but user should be asked whenever a sync might make sense! (e.g. before starting a new shopping list)
		-> reminder instead of asking at certain points?

- UPDATE PHONES WITH RELEASE VERSION! (might be slower because of this atm...)

- shopping list page: recipes sortable by due date?

- Android: manifest file + icon missing! How to do this using cmake + qt creator?
- TODOs (depends on Qt bugfixes)


Possible additional features (unsorted)
---------------------------------------

- iPhone version

- add "essensplanung" functionality!
	* data handling between devices?
		-> depends on data exchange between app and desktop program (and between apps)!
		-> how to keep this up to date? separate file (e.g. saved on dropbox similar to current odt?)
	* also add support for something like "Einkaufsliste.txt" (i.e. list of general items to be bought)
	* where to implement this?
		- list separated from shopping list (e.g. because there are items on the shopping list not present in "essensplanung"
			-> shopping list gets the functionality to import a range of dates from "essensplanung"
		- replacement (which might be used concurrently?) to "shopping list page" that directly generates a shopping list for a user-defined time period?

- Add pictures to Recipes?  (How to do that with json? Or does this depend on a binary internal file format?)
- Internal binary file format? (to speed up reading and writing and/or decrease data usage on disc)
