5. RecipeBook for android
	- improve shopping list page (visual arrangement and scrolling performance)!
	
	- (optional?) start screen?
	- android: what exactly should the back button do in which cases? (open / close side panel? close app? go to "start screen"? What should happen on settings screen?)

	- Adjust everything to smaller screens!
	- improve startup time on android as much as possible (-> qt examples seem to load much faster, but they have much simpler qml...! 
		-> maybe a dedicated startup screen already helps?)
	
	- Test everything!
	
	- manifest file + icon on android! How to do this using cmake + qt creator?

6. Merge functionality
	-> Manuell merge (i.e. look for differences, ask user which to preserve) or also automatic merge (as much as possible anyways, using a common ancestor)
7. Data exchange between app and desktop program?
8. TODOs, UnitTests
9. Update and finalize Design.txt!

Possibilities for later:
a. Internal binary file format? (to speed up reading and writing and/or decrease data usage on disc)
b. Add pictures to Recipe?  (How to do that with json? Or does this depend on a binary internal file format?)
c. Drag'n'drop file load support on desktop?
