TODO

3. Design and write GUI to manage recipes (feature parity with the app)!

	- ShoppingRecipe and ShoppingList dialogs with all features
		* finish shopping list page (TODOs)
			- changeScalingFactor should round values if possible (and restrict to two digits after comma)!

		* Go shopping dialog! 
			- New features: 
				* nötiges haltbarkeitsdatum / wann man etwas braucht datum in shoppinglist (duedate)
				* gleiche zutaten mit untersch. eigenschaften (z.B. klein/gross, add. info.)
					trotzdem zusammenfassen, aber darunter aufzählung der einzelnen sachen (e.g. * 3 Peperoni,
					darunter eine zeile "2 gross" und eine "1 klein")
				* show somehow in "go shopping" from which shopping recipe the items are coming! (at least as a tooltip, but it'd be better if it were always visible)
	- Thoroughly Test "shopping list" and "go shopping"

	- Refactor and improve whatever i can (if possible, use e.g. a custom listview item that adds what we need like insert/remove/changes of items)
		-> simplify qml files by moving things out of files (and refactor common use cases)
		-> might i be able to get rid of the Switch-Control in recipesTab and combine the two ListViews after refactoring?
	
	- Verify that every feature from the app is present!
	- TODO in serialization!
	- Test everything, esp. also that it works correctly with empty data!
	- Add a reasonable amount of unittests for everything not yet covered!
4. Update Design.txt! (incl. code organization descriptions?)

5. Kochbuch-Exporter
	-> should be configurable, e.g. the user should be able to define which recipes to export (and which not) and this should be saveable as an export configuration.
	-> the same is true for groupings of recipes (cf. current Kochubuch: Pasta, Reis, Kartoffeln, Brunch, ...)
6. Merge functionality
7. TODOs
8. UnitTests!
9. Update and finalize Design.txt!


Possibilities for later:
a. Write json schema?
b. Internal binary file format? (to speed up reading and writing and/or decrease data usage on disc)
c. Add picture to Recipe (and json)?
