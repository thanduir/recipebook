TODO
====

4. Exporters
	* Kochbuch-Exporter
		-> should be configurable, e.g. the user should be able to define which recipes to export (and which not) and this should be saveable as an export configuration.
		-> this includes the ability to group included recipes (cf. current Kochubuch: Pasta, Reis, Kartoffeln, Brunch, ...)
	* Go shopping pdf exporter TODOs

	* Try to minimze miktex folder size and copy it to a final place!
		-> Change pdflatex path in RBLatexExporter to final path!
		-> i probably also need to change app working dir for this to work!
		=> remove from .gitignore and commit!
	* Remove the QtHtml exporter? -> yes, if miktex can be reduced to a acceptable folder size
4.5 BUG: Group not together directly after inserting Bibimbap into shopping list!

5. Investigate "recipebook as an app from the same codebase" (and implement if possible)
6. Merge functionality
	-> Manuell merge (i.e. look for differences, ask user which to preserve) or also automatic merge (as much as possible anyways, using a common ancestor)
7. TODOs
8. UnitTests
9. Update and finalize Design.txt!

Possibilities for later:
a. Internal binary file format? (to speed up reading and writing and/or decrease data usage on disc)
b. Add pictures to Recipe?  (How to do that with json? Or does this depend on a binary internal file format?)
