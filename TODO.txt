3. Design and write GUI to manage recipes (feature parity with the app)!
	
	- Go shopping dialog: Show additional information!
	
	- provenance should be (replaced by) a (negativ?) list!
	- "Used in ..." list in ingredients need to be scrollable (see e.g. Peperoni)
	- use std::function instead of template argument in ItemsUtil.h!
	- Refactor and improve whatever i can (if possible, use e.g. a custom listview item that adds what we need like insert/remove/changes of items)
		-> simplify qml files by moving things out of files (and refactor common use cases)
			-> also keep in mind that i might want to use the same controls for the smartphone version!
		-> might i be able to get rid of the Switch-Control in recipesTab and combine the two ListViews after refactoring?
	
	- Verify that every feature from the app is present!
	- TODO in serialization!
	- Test everything, esp. also that it works correctly with empty data!
	- Add a reasonable amount of unittests for everything not yet covered!
	- shopping list (or, rather, go shopping) pdf exporter
4. Update Design.txt! (incl. code organization descriptions?)

5. Kochbuch-Exporter
	-> should be configurable, e.g. the user should be able to define which recipes to export (and which not) and this should be saveable as an export configuration.
	-> the same is true for groupings of recipes (cf. current Kochubuch: Pasta, Reis, Kartoffeln, Brunch, ...)
6. Merge functionality
7. TODOs
8. UnitTests!
9. Update and finalize Design.txt!


Possibilities for later:
a. Write json schema?
b. Internal binary file format? (to speed up reading and writing and/or decrease data usage on disc)
c. Add picture to Recipe (and json)?
