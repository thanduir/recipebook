5. RecipeBook for android
	- Test everything on small screen!
		* häckchen in shopping list dialog verwirrend
			-> "löschen per swipe" entfernen? anderes symbol? Häckchen nur noch für Gruppenelemente?
				
		* ingredients page (and partially also shopping list page): after adding new ingredients, its not correctly opened! (probably missing a component assignment)
			- the same happens for renames! (and probably also in shopping list page for recipe items)
			-> missing component assignment, but how to actually do this when just setting the highlighted element?
			-> maybe using "onCurrentItemChanged" and "currentItem" from ListView
	
	- manifest file + icon on android! How to do this using cmake + qt creator?

6. Merge functionality
	-> Manuell merge (i.e. look for differences, ask user which to preserve) or also automatic merge (as much as possible anyways, using a common ancestor)
7. Data exchange between app and desktop program?
8. TODOs, UnitTests
9. Update and finalize Design.txt!

Possibilities for later:
a. Internal binary file format? (to speed up reading and writing and/or decrease data usage on disc)
b. Add pictures to Recipe?  (How to do that with json? Or does this depend on a binary internal file format?)
c. Drag'n'drop file load support on desktop?
d. shopping list page: recipes sortable by due date?
