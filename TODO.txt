TODO
====

- Regularly update Design.txt to keep it uptodate!

3. Design and write GUI to manage recipes (feature parity with the app)!
	- Should recipes have a bool value "(not) in recipe book" so that it is possible to ignore it for cooking book exports? Or should this be handled separately while exporting?
		-> if so, then this should be marked in the recipes list (recipesTab) (and setable obviously)!
	- sortable recipe items list
		-> Separate mode or map it onto the same listview as well?
	
	- Define top-level layout concept
	- ShoppingRecipe and ShoppingList dialogs with all features 
		* how to handle new groups? Insert all and mark them somehow? Let user chose which to take (also allow choosing more than one!)? Let the user chose one per group?
		* new features from app todo:
			- nötiges haltbarkeitsdatum / wann man etwas braucht datum in shoppinglist (duedate)
			- in go shopping: gleiche zutaten mit untersch. eigenschaften (z.B. klein/gross, add. info.)
				trotzdem zusammenfassen, aber darunter aufzählung der einzelnen sachen (e.g. * 3 Peperoni,
				darunter eine zeile "2 gross" und eine "1 klein")
	- (Relevant) settings from app, esp. the default values (cf. references in c++ models code)
	- "Search as you type" like feature for (large) ListViews? (i could do this with a search box, but is there no direct way? maybe with a key pressed handler?)

	- Refactor and improve whatever i can (if possible, use e.g. a custom listview item that adds what we need like insert/remove/changes of items)
		-> in ListViews scroll to item with typing? (e.g. jump to first item starting with "m" when "m" is pressed while focused)
	
	- Verify that every feature from the app is present!
	- Test everything, esp. also that it works with empty data!
	- Add a reasonable amount of unittests for everything not yet covered!
