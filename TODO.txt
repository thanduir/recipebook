TODO
====

- Android: manifest file + icon missing! How to do this using cmake + qt creator?
- TODOs (depends on Qt bugfixes)


Possible additional features (unsorted)
---------------------------------------

- shopping list page: recipes sortable by due date?
- add "essensplanung" functionality!
	-> how to keep this up to date? separate file (e.g. saved on dropbox similar to current odt?)
	-> how to sync this with shopping list? (there are things on the shopping list not present here...)
	-> also add support for something like "Einkaufsliste.txt"
- iPhone version
- Data exchange between app and desktop program?
- Merge functionality
	-> Manuell merge (i.e. look for differences, ask user which to preserve) or also automatic merge (as much as possible anyways, using a common ancestor)

- Add pictures to Recipes?  (How to do that with json? Or does this depend on a binary internal file format?)
- Internal binary file format? (to speed up reading and writing and/or decrease data usage on disc)
