TODO
====

- Regularly update Design.txt to keep it uptodate!

1. Write unit test: import file (cmd line input?) and output it again (possibly in another format). 
	-> Test that the two files are equal after the test!
2. Extend RecipeBook classes (i.e. the recipes) with everything that's needed for Kochbuch-Exporter (e.g. descriptions etc.)
	-> add to json, but also other "JsonForApp" enum value which removes these values from the output
	- to be added:
		* Recipe short description
		* cooking duration
		* Long description (incl. line breaks)
		* picture? (how/where to save them though?)
3. Design and write GUI to manage recipes (Qt Widget or Qt Quick?)

4. Kochbuch-Exporter
5. Merge functionality
6. TODOs
7. Write json schema?
8. Internal binary file format? (to speed up reading and writing)
