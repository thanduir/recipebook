TODO
====

4. Change build system to cmake
	* Setup subdir CMakeLists.txt and make everything work / compile!
		- librecipebook
		- rbunittests
		- recipebookgui
	* Change absolute paths in code to relative ones (in a way that works for release, debug and installations, i.e. avoid having to maintain copies in both folders!)
		-> atm relevant (at least) for: pdflatex.exe (RBLatexExporter) and qm-Files (2x in RBTranslationManager)
		-> add miktex to git (and remove from .gitignore) after it reach its final resting place!
	* fix UNITTESTS (CR/LF vs. LF...)
	* Remove VS Qt Tools Addin? (as it doesn't quite work as expected anyways..)
	* update .gitignore!

	* test with different compilers? (msvc, cygwin-gcc)
	* Make install ready version! (i.e. prepare it in such a way that i can just copy the release folder to install it? Or how to ensure new enough qt binaries?)

5. Investigate "recipebook as an app from the same codebase" (and implement if possible)
	-> using VS or Qt Creator for this?

6. Merge functionality
	-> Manuell merge (i.e. look for differences, ask user which to preserve) or also automatic merge (as much as possible anyways, using a common ancestor)
7. Data exchange between app and desktop program?
8. TODOs, UnitTests
9. Update and finalize Design.txt!

Possibilities for later:
a. Internal binary file format? (to speed up reading and writing and/or decrease data usage on disc)
b. Add pictures to Recipe?  (How to do that with json? Or does this depend on a binary internal file format?)
