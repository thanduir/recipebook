2. Exporters
	* Pdf layout changes:
		- recipe items / recipe text: Possibly make the widths different? (recipe text col wider than the other)
		- Larger font sizes on title page (-> Probably need a custom title page for this)

	* Try to minimze miktex folder size and copy it to a final place!
		(bkup in c:\miktex-portable)
		=> remove from .gitignore and commit!

3. Bugs / missing features
	* BUG: Group not together directly after inserting Bibimbap into shopping list!
	* json app export (with unnecessary info removed)
		-> as an option in the export dlg (file type selector)!

4. Change build system to cmake
	* Improve files layout! Atm it's rather confusing...
	* Change absolute paths in code to relative ones (in a way that works for release, debug and installations, i.e. avoid having to maintain copies in both folders!)
		-> atm relevant (at least) for: pdflatex.exe (RBLatexExporter) and qm-Files (2x in RBTranslationManager)
	* post build step to copy qm files!
	* Remove VS Qt Tools Addin? (as it doesn't quite work as expected anyways..)

5. Investigate "recipebook as an app from the same codebase" (and implement if possible)
	-> using VS or Qt Creator for this?

6. Merge functionality
	-> Manuell merge (i.e. look for differences, ask user which to preserve) or also automatic merge (as much as possible anyways, using a common ancestor)
7. TODOs
8. UnitTests
9. Update and finalize Design.txt!

Possibilities for later:
a. Internal binary file format? (to speed up reading and writing and/or decrease data usage on disc)
b. Add pictures to Recipe?  (How to do that with json? Or does this depend on a binary internal file format?)
