5. RecipeBook for android
	- adjust qml files to smaller android screens:
		* AlternativesTypesPage
			-> remove component in "dialogs" and add move code to AlternativesTypesPage (and adjust android version of this)!
		* RecipesPage
		
		* ShoppingListPage
		
		* RecipebooksTab + RbConfigPage
		
		* import / export: can i use std dialogs or should i write my own?
	- TODOs
	- qml warnings
	- Make emulator (x86) work for android variant (with relatively small sceen)!
	- Make sure all features of the desktop app (and the einkaufsliste app) are present on android
	
	- Adjust everything to smaller screens!
	- improve startup time as much as possible (-> qt exmaples seem to load much faster!)

6. Merge functionality
	-> Manuell merge (i.e. look for differences, ask user which to preserve) or also automatic merge (as much as possible anyways, using a common ancestor)
7. Data exchange between app and desktop program?
8. TODOs, UnitTests
9. Update and finalize Design.txt!

Possibilities for later:
a. Internal binary file format? (to speed up reading and writing and/or decrease data usage on disc)
b. Add pictures to Recipe?  (How to do that with json? Or does this depend on a binary internal file format?)
