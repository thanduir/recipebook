TODO
====

- Regularly update Design.txt to keep it uptodate!

1. Write unit test: import file (cmd line input?) and output it again (possibly in another format). Test that the two files are equal afterwards
	-> separate unittest project in this solution!
	- https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtest-overview.html
	- https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtest-tutorial.html
	- or use builtin VS Google Test framework?
2. Extend RecipeBook classes (i.e. the recipes) with everything that's needed for Kochbuch-Exporter (e.g. descriptions etc.)
	-> add this to json format or have a separate output file? together would be better, but the exporter should allow to remove these extraneous data
		for app performance reasons!
	-> make a list of what needs to be added first, then decide!
3. Design and write GUI to manage recipes (Qt Widget or Qt Quick?)
	- https://doc.qt.io/qtvstools/qtvstools-getting-started.html
	- https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtexamplesandtutorials.html
4. Kochbuch-Exporter
5. Merge functionality
6. TODOs
7. Write json schema?
8. Internal binary file format? (to speed up reading and writing)
