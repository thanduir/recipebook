5. RecipeBook for android
	- Add qm files to the resources!
	- adjust qml files to smaller android screens:
		* CategoriesPage
		* IngredientsPage
		* RecipesPage
		
		* ShoppingListPage
		* GoShoppingPage
		
		* RecipebooksTab + RbConfigPage
		
		* components / dialogs?
		* import / export: can i use std dialogs or should i write my own?

6. Merge functionality
	-> Manuell merge (i.e. look for differences, ask user which to preserve) or also automatic merge (as much as possible anyways, using a common ancestor)
7. Data exchange between app and desktop program?
8. TODOs, UnitTests
9. Update and finalize Design.txt!

Possibilities for later:
a. Internal binary file format? (to speed up reading and writing and/or decrease data usage on disc)
b. Add pictures to Recipe?  (How to do that with json? Or does this depend on a binary internal file format?)
