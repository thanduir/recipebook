5. Investigate "recipebook as an app from the same codebase" (and implement if possible)
	- https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/android-getting-started.html
	-> use VS or Qt Creator for this? Qt Creator seems easier. I might also (first) try to use Qt Creator for the windows version.

6. Merge functionality
	-> Manuell merge (i.e. look for differences, ask user which to preserve) or also automatic merge (as much as possible anyways, using a common ancestor)
7. Data exchange between app and desktop program?
8. TODOs, UnitTests
9. Update and finalize Design.txt!

Possibilities for later:
a. Internal binary file format? (to speed up reading and writing and/or decrease data usage on disc)
b. Add pictures to Recipe?  (How to do that with json? Or does this depend on a binary internal file format?)
