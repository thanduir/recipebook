5. RecipeBook for android
	- TODOs
	- qml warnings
	- Textfield handling doesn't work as expected on android tablet for some reason
	- import / export: can i use std dialogs or should i write my own?
		-> Need something else, probably just similar to the current app! (Permissions!)
	- android: "back" button should open side panel, if it isn't open, and close the app if it is open.
	- Make emulator (x86) work for android variant (with relatively small sceen)!
	- Make sure all features of the desktop app (and the einkaufsliste app) are present on android
	
	- Adjust to and test everything on smaller screens!
	- improve startup time as much as possible (-> qt exmaples seem to load much faster!)

6. Merge functionality
	-> Manuell merge (i.e. look for differences, ask user which to preserve) or also automatic merge (as much as possible anyways, using a common ancestor)
7. Data exchange between app and desktop program?
8. TODOs, UnitTests
9. Update and finalize Design.txt!

Possibilities for later:
a. Internal binary file format? (to speed up reading and writing and/or decrease data usage on disc)
b. Add pictures to Recipe?  (How to do that with json? Or does this depend on a binary internal file format?)
