TODO
====

- Bug: Punkte in Zahlen(amount) -> seems to work again, but not updated correctly
- qt uses "-deployment-settings.json" files for android settings. Is there something similar
	i could use for icons + manifest file? (cf. below)
	* Android: manifest file + icon missing! How to do this using cmake + qt creator? 

- Recipe books tab: better UI (-> desktop only)
- shopping list page: recipes sortable by due date?
- items to choose one from during shopping (instead of before shopping)?

- Data synchronisation (sync with dropbox)
	* Implement RecipeBookSynchronization and sync UI (where to user gets asked which change to keep in case of problems)
	* compile test with qt creator
	* Unittest for compare/merge algorithm(s)!
	* TODOs

	* translations
	
	* Test every code path on windows and android!
		-> ssl missing on android...
		-> https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/android-openssl-support.html
	
	* Replace merge with a sync icon?


Possible additional features (unsorted)
---------------------------------------

- iPhone version

- add "essensplanung" functionality!
	* data handling between devices?
		-> depends on data exchange between app and desktop program (and between apps)!
		-> how to keep this up to date? separate file (e.g. saved on dropbox similar to current odt?)
	* also add support for something like "Einkaufsliste.txt" (i.e. list of general items to be bought)
	* where to implement this?
		- list separated from shopping list (e.g. because there are items on the shopping list not present in "essensplanung"
			-> shopping list gets the functionality to import a range of dates from "essensplanung"
		- replacement (which might be used concurrently?) to "shopping list page" that directly generates a shopping list for a user-defined time period?

- Add pictures to Recipes?  (How to do that with json? Or does this depend on a binary internal file format?)
- Internal binary file format? (to speed up reading and writing and/or decrease data usage on disc)
