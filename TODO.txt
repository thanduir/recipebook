TODO
====

- Regularly update Design.txt to keep it uptodate!

1. Internal data classes, similar to what's already done in the app (but extended with the needs of this app)
	-> Top-Down approach: RecipeBook class that contains all lists! (and returns information structs o.ä. for Category, SortOrder, Ingredient, Recipe etc.)
	-> ALSO ADD SHOPPINGLIST!
	- Kommentare?
	- TODOs
1.5 I need some way to ensure data format stability, esp. with the enums (ensure the values are the same on win and android)!
	-> also import for c_strProvenanceEverywhere in java!
2. Internal format serialization -> Format: json? xml? custom binary format? At least allow several serialization methods in theory
3. Define and implement extensions needed for json file format (per instance / device GUID. also decide on whether to add a date for shoppingrecipes)
4. json-Importer / -Exporter (no merging)
5. Design and write GUI to manage recipes (Qt Widget or Qt Quick?)
