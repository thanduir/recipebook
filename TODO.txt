5. Investigate "recipebook as an app from the same codebase" (and implement if possible)
	- Setup handling of different qmls for different target systems!
	- I might need to add the qm files to the resources
	- rethink app UI: Get rid of current ugly start screen!
		->sidepanel for navigation, starting in shopping list mode?

6. Merge functionality
	-> Manuell merge (i.e. look for differences, ask user which to preserve) or also automatic merge (as much as possible anyways, using a common ancestor)
7. Data exchange between app and desktop program?
8. TODOs, UnitTests
9. Update and finalize Design.txt!

Possibilities for later:
a. Internal binary file format? (to speed up reading and writing and/or decrease data usage on disc)
b. Add pictures to Recipe?  (How to do that with json? Or does this depend on a binary internal file format?)
