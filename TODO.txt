4. Exporters
	* Pdf layout changes:
		- recipe items / recipe text: Possibly make the widths different? (recipe text col wider than the other)
		- Larger font sizes on title page (-> Probably need a custom title page for this)

	* Need language options:
		- program language in settings
		- language setting in recipe book pdf generation page
		-> https://wiki.qt.io/How_to_create_a_multi_language_application
		-> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15355156/is-it-possible-to-change-language-on-qt-at-runtime
	
	* Try to minimze miktex folder size and copy it to a final place!
		-> Change pdflatex path in RBLatexExporter to final path!
		-> i probably also need to change app working dir for this to work!
		=> remove from .gitignore and commit!
	* Remove the QtHtml exporter? -> yes, if miktex can be reduced to an acceptable folder size
	* Export-classes should have a (qml-readable) exportPossible-Method (with no QtHTtml-Exporter, it might just test the existance of the pdflatex executable)
4.2 BUG: Group not together directly after inserting Bibimbap into shopping list!
4.3 json app export (with unnecessary info removed)
	-> as an option in the export dlg (file type selector)! 

5. Investigate "recipebook as an app from the same codebase" (and implement if possible)
6. Merge functionality
	-> Manuell merge (i.e. look for differences, ask user which to preserve) or also automatic merge (as much as possible anyways, using a common ancestor)
7. TODOs
8. UnitTests
9. Update and finalize Design.txt!

Possibilities for later:
a. Internal binary file format? (to speed up reading and writing and/or decrease data usage on disc)
b. Add pictures to Recipe?  (How to do that with json? Or does this depend on a binary internal file format?)
c. cmake based build system (and linux builds)?
