TODO
====

- RecipeBook for android
	- ingredients page (and partially also shopping list page): after adding new ingredients, its not correctly opened! (probably missing a component assignment)
		- the same happens for renames! (and probably also in shopping list page for recipe items)
		-> missing component assignment, but how to actually do this when just setting the highlighted element?
		-> maybe using "onCurrentItemChanged" and "currentItem" from ListView
	
	- manifest file + icon on android! How to do this using cmake + qt creator?

- look for usability improvements on desktop
- TODOs, UnitTests
- Update and finalize Design.txt!


Possible additional features (unsorted)
---------------------------------------

- Drag'n'drop file load support on desktop?
- add "essensplanung" functionality!
	-> how to keep this up to date? separate file (e.g. saved on dropbox similar to current odt?)
	-> how to sync this with shopping list? (there are things on the shopping list not present here...)
	-> also add support for something like "Einkaufsliste.txt"
- shopping list page: recipes sortable by due date?
- Merge functionality
	-> Manuell merge (i.e. look for differences, ask user which to preserve) or also automatic merge (as much as possible anyways, using a common ancestor)
- iPhone version
- Add pictures to Recipes?  (How to do that with json? Or does this depend on a binary internal file format?)
- Internal binary file format? (to speed up reading and writing and/or decrease data usage on disc)
- Data exchange between app and desktop program?
