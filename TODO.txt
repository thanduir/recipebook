TODO
====

4.0 Replace "id string" by explicit type? (would avoid a few possible errors...)
4.1 Exporters
	* Kochbuch-Exporter
		- data class:
			* need a method to return currently not included recipes?
			* header level consistency checks in data classes? (probably not)
			* serialization (in normal json for now, but excluded in app config!)
			* TODOs

		- UI:
			* cbx (or tabs? or listview?) to chose active config (+ adding and removal of configs)
			* textboxes etc. for additional settings (font, title, ...)
			* sortable list of recipes into which headers can be inserted (and which are moveable)
				- user sortable
				- separate add recipe and add header buttons. Both can be inserted before current item (or, alternatively, at the end of the list)
				- add recipe button shows only recipes that are not currently present in the list
					-> Alternative: a second ListView showing the recipes not currently added (and instead of add/remove buttons, buttons to move items between the two lists)
				- list items are removeable (button at the end as usual)
				- headers have a cbx or spinbox to adjust their level (this as consistency requirements though)
			
	* Try to minimze miktex folder size and copy it to a final place!
		-> Change pdflatex path in RBLatexExporter to final path!
		-> i probably also need to change app working dir for this to work!
		=> remove from .gitignore and commit!
	* Remove the QtHtml exporter? -> yes, if miktex can be reduced to a acceptable folder size
	* Export-class should have a (qml-readable) exportPossible-Method (with no QtHTtml-Exporter, it might just test the existance of the pdflatex executable)
4.2 BUG: Group not together directly after inserting Bibimbap into shopping list!
4.3 json app export (with unnecessary info removed)

5. Investigate "recipebook as an app from the same codebase" (and implement if possible)
6. Merge functionality
	-> Manuell merge (i.e. look for differences, ask user which to preserve) or also automatic merge (as much as possible anyways, using a common ancestor)
7. TODOs
8. UnitTests
9. Update and finalize Design.txt!

Possibilities for later:
a. Internal binary file format? (to speed up reading and writing and/or decrease data usage on disc)
b. Add pictures to Recipe?  (How to do that with json? Or does this depend on a binary internal file format?)
