5. RecipeBook for android
	- qml warnings
	- file export: ask user if file overwritten!
	- Bug: Crash on import old file (from einkaufsliste)! (android only? Or on all devices?)
	
	- android: "back" button should open side panel, if it isn't open, and close the app if it is open.
	- Make emulator (x86) work for android variant (with relatively small sceen)!
	- manifest file + icon on android! Can i (with this) also fix the wrong app name prefix (org.qtproject.example.RecipeBook)
	
	- Make sure all features of the desktop app (and the einkaufsliste app) are present on android
	- Adjust to and test everything on smaller screens!
	- improve performance of scrolling (ingredients + shopping list) and item filtering (ingredients)!
	- rework shopping list page
	- settings on small screens!
	- How to handle activity reloads (when app is minimized or similar)?
	- Save interval on android? When is "onClosing" actually called? Is data (nearly) always saved atm or do i need improvements?
	- (optional?) start screen?
	- improve startup time on android as much as possible (-> qt examples seem to load much faster!)

6. Merge functionality
	-> Manuell merge (i.e. look for differences, ask user which to preserve) or also automatic merge (as much as possible anyways, using a common ancestor)
7. Data exchange between app and desktop program?
8. TODOs, UnitTests
9. Update and finalize Design.txt!

Possibilities for later:
a. Internal binary file format? (to speed up reading and writing and/or decrease data usage on disc)
b. Add pictures to Recipe?  (How to do that with json? Or does this depend on a binary internal file format?)
c. Drag'n'drop file load support on desktop?
