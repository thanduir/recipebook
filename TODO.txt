TODO

3. Design and write GUI to manage recipes (feature parity with the app)!
	- Implement standard features:
		* define data save folder / file name! (-> should be in app data folder)
		* implement save incl. asking for save on unsaved data!
		* Saves as -> Export data (implementation finished?)
		* implement file load
		* save as / load should probably remember last used folder!
		* TODOs (most of them should be doable now)

	- ShoppingRecipe and ShoppingList dialogs with all features
		* how to handle new groups? Insert all and mark them somehow? Let user chose which to take (also allow choosing more than one!)? Let the user chose one per group?
		* new features from app todo:
			- nötiges haltbarkeitsdatum / wann man etwas braucht datum in shoppinglist (duedate)
			- in go shopping: gleiche zutaten mit untersch. eigenschaften (z.B. klein/gross, add. info.)
				trotzdem zusammenfassen, aber darunter aufzählung der einzelnen sachen (e.g. * 3 Peperoni,
				darunter eine zeile "2 gross" und eine "1 klein")
	- Refactor and improve whatever i can (if possible, use e.g. a custom listview item that adds what we need like insert/remove/changes of items)
		-> simplify qml files by moving things out of files (and refactor common use cases)
		-> might i be able to get rid of the Switch-Control in recipesTab and combine the two ListViews after refactoring?
	
	- Verify that every feature from the app is present!
	- Test everything, esp. also that it works with empty data!
	- Add a reasonable amount of unittests for everything not yet covered!
4. Update Design.txt! (incl. code organization descriptions?)

5. Kochbuch-Exporter
	-> should be configurable, e.g. the user should be able to define which recipes to export (and which not) and this should be saveable as an export configuration.
6. Merge functionality
7. TODOs
8. UnitTests!
9. Update and finalize Design.txt!


Possibilities for later:
a. Write json schema?
b. Internal binary file format? (to speed up reading and writing and/or decrease data usage on disc)
c. Add picture to Recipe (and json)?
